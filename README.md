# Plotting and mapping of reindeer data in Bjorndalen and Adventdalen
## Description
Data about Reindeer has been collected for years by students in the valleys Adventdalen and Bjorndalen on Svalbard. This collection of scripts will help to visualise and understand the data that was collected while showing methods to create maps in R.
